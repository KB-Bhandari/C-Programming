This folder focuses on pointers in C programming, one of the most powerful concepts in the language.
It includes examples and programs that demonstrate pointer basics, pointer arithmetic, pointers with arrays, strings, functions, and structures, 
as well as advanced concepts like double pointers and dynamic memory allocation. 
These programs are meant to strengthen understanding of memory management and the way C handles data through addresses.
